/*
Interface is a description of a action that an object can do
an interface can be written in same way that class as class declaration with keyword Interface

Rules:
1-> All the method decalred in interface must be public
2->An Interface is implemented within the class so in case of error it will populate some fatal error.
3->The class implementing the interface must use the exact same method signatures as are defined in the interface
4->Interfaces can be extended like classes using the extends operator.
